# RL Pacman #

## Overview ##

A reinforcement learning agent for Pac-Man developed using Python. The agent uses Value Iteration and Q-Learning algorithms to optimize gameplay.

## Concepts and Performance ##

Value Iteration: Calculates optimal policies using the Bellman Equation.

Q-Learning: Implements epsilon-greedy exploration for efficient learning.

Performance: Achieved a final grade of 103% after training over 50 games.

## Key Project Files ##

qlearningAgents.py: Q-Learning implementation with Q-value updates and exploration strategy.

valueIterationAgents.py: Value Iteration implementation for policy optimization.
